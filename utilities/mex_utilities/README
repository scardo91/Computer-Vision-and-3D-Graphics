Utilities for MEX files
Copyright 2008-2009 Levente Hunyadi

C utility functions to simplify writing MEX source files and a make command to build them.

The package contains a set of C functions and preprocessor macros to simplify writing MEX source files. The routines help check input and output argument count, argument type, dimension and structure in a MEX file. See "common.c" in the subfolder "include" for details.

Sample code is included in the subfolder "example" to demonstrate usage. Examples include squared Euclidean distance between two vectors, a vector and a set of vectors, and between two paired sets of vectors; Kronecker tensor product; Hankel and Toeplitz matrix construction; and catenation of a cell array of sparse matrices into a single sparse matrix.

The package also features a make utility that recompiles all C (.c) and C++ (.cpp) MEX source files in a directory hierarchy using a common include directory, checking modification date to avoid unnecessary recompilation.
